* Introduction
  - OSSEC is an open-source, host-based intrusion detection system
    (HIDS) that performs log analysis, integrity checking, Windows
    registry monitoring, rootkit detection, time-based alerting, and
    active response. It's the application to install on your server if
    you want to keep an eye on what's happening inside it. OSSEC is
    supported on Windows and all Unix-like operating systems.
* OSSEC Architecture
  - OSSEC is composed of multiple pieces. It has a central manager for
    monitoring and receiving information from agents, syslog,
    databases, and from agentless devices.

** Manager (or Server)
   - The manager or server is the central piece of the OSSEC
     deployment. It stores the file integrity checking databases, the
     logs, events, and system auditing entries. All the rules,
     decoders, and major configuration options are stored centrally in
     the manager; making it easy to administer even a large number of
     agents.

   - Agents connect to the server on port 1514/udp. Communication to this
     port must be allowed for agents to communicate with the server.

** Agents
   - The agent is a small program, or collection of programs,
     installed on the systems to be monitored. The agent will collect
     information and forward it to the manager for analysis and
     correlation. Some information is collected in real time, others
     periodically. It has a very small memory and CPU footprint by
     default, not affecting the system¡¯s usage.

   - Agent security: It runs with a low privilege user (generally created
     during the installation) and inside a chroot jail isolated from the
     system. Most of the agent configuration can be pushed from the
     manager.

** Agentless
   - For systems that an agent cannot be installed on, the agentless
     support may allow integrity checks to be performed. Agentless
     scans can be used to monitor firewalls, routers, and even Unix
     systems.

** Virtualization/VMware
   - OSSEC allows you to install the agent on the guest operating
     systems. It may also be installed inside some versions of VMWare
     ESX, but this may cause support issues. 
   - With the agent installed inside VMware ESX you can get alerts
     about when a VM guest is being installed, removed, started,
     etc. It also monitors logins, logouts and errors inside the ESX
     server. 
   - In addition to that, OSSEC performs the Center for
     Internet Security (CIS) checks for VMware, alerting if there is
     any insecure configuration option enabled or any other issue.

** Firewalls, switches and routers
   - OSSEC can receive and analyze syslog events from a large variety
     of firewalls, switches and routers. It supports all Cisco
     routers, Cisco PIX, Cisco FWSM, Cisco ASA, Juniper Routers,
     Netscreen firewall, Checkpoint and many others.

** Architecture
   - This diagram shows the central manager receiving events from the
     agents and system logs from remote devices. When something is
     detected, active responses can be executed and the admin is
     notified.

** Pre-requisites
   - Two centos6 Droplets. Make sure to take note of the IP
     addresses of both. We'll refer to these as server_ip and
     agent_ip, respectively.
   - A sudo non-root user on both Droplets.
   - Iptables firewall enabled on both. In Linux, the latest stable
     release of OSSEC needs iptables for its active response
     feature. 
     
*** Firewalls and Iptables
    *Firewalls*
    - A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or
      from a private network. You can implement a firewall in either
      hardware or software form, or a combination of both. 
    - Firewalls prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing
      private networks connected to the Internet, especially
      intranets. 
    - All messages entering or leaving the intranet (i.e.,
      the local network to which you are connected) must pass through
      the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that
      do not meet the specified security criteria.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  yum install system-config-firewall*
  #+END_EXAMPLE
    - Follow the instructions on How To Set Up
      a Firewall Using Iptables on Centos 6 to set up iptables on
      both servers.

    *Iptables*
    - iptables is a user-space utility program that allows a system
      administrator to configure the tables[2] provided by the Linux
      kernel firewall (implemented as different Netfilter modules) and
      the chains and rules it stores. Different kernel modules and
      programs are currently used for different protocols; iptables
      applies to IPv4, ip6tables to IPv6, arptables to ARP, and
      ebtables to Ethernet frames.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  yum install iptables.x86_64 
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Creating containers for both server and client
    *Steps to create Containers on both server and client are same*
    - Login to base4 and create a container as follows:
      + Open terminal with below command by pressing *ctrl+alt+t*.
      + Use below command to login to the base4
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ssh user@10.4.12.24
  #+END_EXAMPLE
      + It awill ask for the password, then sitch to root as below:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sudo su
  #+END_EXAMPLE
      + Create a container with the below command:
	1. for server
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   vzctl create 31 --ostemplate centos-6.9-x86_64-with-emacs --diskspace 20G:25.0G --hostname server.vlabs.ac.in --ipadd 10.4.12.31
  #+END_EXAMPLE
        2. Start and enter in to the container as follows:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  vzctl start 31
  vzctl enter 31
  #+END_EXAMPLE
        3. for client
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  vzctl create 40 --ostemplate centos-6.9-x86_64-with-emacs --diskspace 20G:25.0G --hostname client.vlabs.ac.in --ipadd 10.4.12.40
  #+END_EXAMPLE
        4. Start and enter in to the container as follows:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  vzctl start 31
  vzctl enter 31
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Installation and configuration of OSSEC on server

** Steps to install and configure OSSEC on server and client
   - Log into the server and client containers and update using the below command:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     yum update
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Installation of OSSEC involves some compiling, so install gcc
     and make. Instead of installing both, install a single
     package called build-essential with the below command:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     install build-essential inotify-tools
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - The latest server edition of OSSEC is version 2.8.1. To download
     it, type:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     wget -U ossec http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-2.8.1.tar.gz
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - To download the checksum file, type:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     wget -U ossec http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-2.8.1-checksum.txt
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - To untar the downloaded ossec-hids-2.8.1.tar.gz, type:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     tar -xvf ossec-hids-2.8.1.tar.gz
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - It extracts all the files to ossec-hids-2.8.1
   - Change directory to ossec-hids-2.8.1, type:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     cd ossec-hids-2.8.1
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - It list all the files in the ossec-hids-2.8.1
   - Run below command to install ossec
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ./install.sh
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Select language, default is English: hit enter
   - Next it will show the system detail, system user and host-name.
   - Now select installation modes and type of OSSEC on the system.
   - Set the configurations path, /var/ossec is default.
   - Enter the server IP address
   - Now enable integrity check for agent.
   - Next enable rootkit detection, active response and syslog.
   - Press “enter” to start installation process.
   - Next it show some information like OS Detail Start and Stop OSSEC
     scripts and OSSEC configurations file.
   - Press “Enter” to finish the OSSEC Client/Agent installation part.
   - Now Client/Agent side installation is done.

** Connecting Server and Agent
*** Server Side Configuration
    - Adding a client :- Follow the below command to add client.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    - Type *a* to add an agent.
    - Then provide a new name, IP and ID for the agent.
    - Then type *e* to extract the key for an agent.
    - Now copy the givem *Agent Information Key* to enter it for the agent.
*** Agent Side Configuration
    - Follow the below steps to add agent to server.
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      # /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - Type *i* to import key from the server.
    - Provide the Key generated by the server.
    - Then type q to quit back to the  main menu.
    - To restart OSSEC Server and Agent, type:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
      #+END_EXAMPLE
