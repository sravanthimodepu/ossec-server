* Introduction
  - OSSEC is an open-source, host-based intrusion detection system
    (HIDS) that performs log analysis, integrity checking, Windows
    registry monitoring, rootkit detection, time-based alerting, and
    active response. It's the application to install on your server if
    you want to keep an eye on what's happening inside it. OSSEC is
    supported on Windows and all Unix-like operating systems.
* OSSEC Architecture
  - OSSEC is composed of multiple pieces. It has a central manager for
    monitoring and receiving information from agents, syslog,
    databases, and from agentless devices.
** Manager (or Server)
   - The manager is the central piece of the OSSEC deployment. It
     stores the file integrity checking databases, the logs, events,
     and system auditing entries. All the rules, decoders, and major
     configuration options are stored centrally in the manager; making
     it easy to administer even a large number of agents.

   - Agents connect to the server on port 1514/udp. Communication to this
     port must be allowed for agents to communicate with the server.
** Agents
   - The agent is a small program, or collection of programs,
     installed on the systems to be monitored. The agent will collect
     information and forward it to the manager for analysis and
     correlation. Some information is collected in real time, others
     periodically. It has a very small memory and CPU footprint by
     default, not affecting the system¡¯s usage.

   - Agent security: It runs with a low privilege user (generally created
     during the installation) and inside a chroot jail isolated from the
     system. Most of the agent configuration can be pushed from the
     manager.
** Agentless
   - For systems that an agent cannot be installed on, the agentless
     support may allow integrity checks to be performed. Agentless
     scans can be used to monitor firewalls, routers, and even Unix
     systems.
** Virtualization/VMware
   - OSSEC allows you to install the agent on the guest operating
     systems. It may also be installed inside some versions of VMWare
     ESX, but this may cause support issues. With the agent installed
     inside VMware ESX you can get alerts about when a VM guest is
     being installed, removed, started, etc. It also monitors logins,
     logouts and errors inside the ESX server. In addition to that,
     OSSEC performs the Center for Internet Security (CIS) checks for
     VMware, alerting if there is any insecure configuration option
     enabled or any other issue.
** Firewalls, switches and routers
   - OSSEC can receive and analyze syslog events from a large variety
     of firewalls, switches and routers. It supports all Cisco
     routers, Cisco PIX, Cisco FWSM, Cisco ASA, Juniper Routers,
     Netscreen firewall, Checkpoint and many others.
** Architecture
   - This diagram shows the central manager receiving events from the
     agents and system logs from remote devices. When something is
     detected, active responses can be executed and the admin is
     notified.
